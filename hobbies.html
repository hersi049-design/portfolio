        <p>Here’s a deeper look into my favorite activities and why they matter to me.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Lifting</h2>

            <p>Lifting keeps me disciplined, motivated, and focused on personal growth. I lift 5 days a week, Monday through Friday. Most of the time I'm with a friend of mine to keep each other motivated. </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>Cooking</h2>

            <p>Cooking allows me to explore creativity and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I first learned to cook at 11 years old. My mom taught me everything I need to know about cooking, making it more precious to me. One of my favorite dishes to make is a Somali dish called "Bariis Iskukaris", which is a spiced rice dish served with meat.</p>

            <p>Reading and journaling help me reflect, learn, and develop creativity. I only recently started being a consistent reader, but so far it has made me a more creative and knowledgable person. I journal everything that comes to mind, and that's one of thhe biggest reasons as to why I started journaling, to help clear my mind. <p>

            <p>Walking outdoors is relaxing, gives me fresh ideas, and keeps me active. I actually took these beautiful pictures during my walks. I enjoy being outdoors to think and take in the world around me. </p>
